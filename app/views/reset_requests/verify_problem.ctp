<h2>Forgot Your Password?</h2> 

<div class="Wrapped">
<p class="Error">Whoops! Something went wrong.</p>
<p>Something went wrong while trying to verify your e-mail so that you can reset your password.
The link you got in your email is only good for a short time, usually about 30 minutes.  It seems yours has expired, or something else when wrong.</p>
<p>No worries - just go <?php echo $html->link('enter your email address again',array('action'=>'index'))?> and we'll send another email right away.</p>
</div>
